# Crestron Device Command Documenter
Generates good looking HTML Documentation for normal and hidden Crestron device commands. 32-bit binary available from release page.

----------
**April 4, 2016 - Important bugfix.** The regular expression I was using to capture the help explanations was too small for some important commands -- commands that were showing no help text in the initial release version. I realized the problem this evening and have uploaded the corrected source. I will upload an updated binary shortly.

----------
- Written using Python 2.7
- Authentication is not currently supported.
- The regex's may have to be tweaked for different devices. 

----------
I suggest you create a batch file for all Crestron devices on a network and let it generate a full set of documentation.
