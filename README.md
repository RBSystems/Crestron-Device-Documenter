# Crestron Device Command Documenter
Generates good looking HTML Documentation for normal and hidden Crestron device commands. Precompiled binary available from release page.

----------
July 2017

- Largely rewritten to clean up the code, add new functionality and conform more closely to PEP 8.
- The program will now take a command-line parameter, a filename that points to a text file containing known or "word of mouth" commands that are not included in the existing help commands. These will be tested for, saved to a .upc file, and added to the HTML documentation if they exist.
- Regex improvement so that more devices are now supported

August 2017

- Firmware version regex improved
- Additional refactoring of code to cleanup code
- General help capture regex improved to handle more devices
- Automatic detection of Crestron devices using UDP using -alc option
- If working via VPN or router that prevents UDP, use the -ala option to determine active devices on network, test each device for Crestron console and build documentation for all devices that provide console
- Support for SSH added (first pass; needs testing)

## Example Program Usage ##

**Build documentation for a single Crestron device that provides console:**
<pre>
BuildCrestronCommandReference -ip 10.61.101.24
</pre>

**Build documentation for a single Crestron device using SSH:**
<pre>
BuildCrestronCommandReference -ip 10.61.101.24 -fssh -uid cresuser -pwd pptron9
</pre>

**Build documentation for all Crestron devices on all (computer connected) subnets that respond to UDP and provide a console:**
<pre>
BuildCrestronCommandReference -alc
</pre>

**Build documentation for all devices that are active on 10.61.101.0/24 that provide a Crestron console:**
<pre>
BuildCrestronCommandReference -ala 10.61.101
</pre>

**Build documentation for a single Crestron device that provides console adding any valid commands found in addtlcmds.txt:**
<pre>
BuildCrestronCommandReference -ip 10.61.101.24 -atc addtlcmds.txt
</pre>


## To Do ##
 - Additional testing and cleanup

## Notes ##
- Some Crestron devices only support a single console session so be sure Toolbox is completely shut down if running against multiple devices
- Written using Python 2.7
