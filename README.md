# Crestron Device Command Documenter
Generates good looking HTML Documentation for normal and hidden Crestron device commands.

----------

- Written using Python 2.7
- Authentication is not currently supported.
- The regex's may have to be tweaked for different devices. 

----------
I suggest you create a batch file for all Crestron devices on a network and let it generate a full set of documentation.
