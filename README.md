# Crestron Device Command Documenter
Generates good looking HTML Documentation for normal and hidden Crestron device commands. Precompiled binary available from release page.

----------
July 2017

- Largely rewritten to clean up the code, add new functionality and conform more closely to PEP 8.
- The program will now take a second command-line parameter, a filename that points to a text file containing known or "word of mouth" commands that are not included in the existing help commands. These will be tested for, saved to a .upc file, and added to the HTML documentation if they exist.
- Regex improvement so that more devices are now supported

August 2017

- Firmware version regex improved
- Additional refactoring of code to cleanup code
- General help capture regex improved to handle more devices

To Do:

 - Additional testing and cleanup
 - Incorporate [code to automatically locate most Crestron devices](https://github.com/StephenGenusa/Crestron-List-Devices-On-Network) using UDP broadcast

----------
- Written using Python 2.7
- Authentication is not currently supported.

----------
I suggest you create a batch file for all Crestron devices on a network and let it generate a full set of documentation.
